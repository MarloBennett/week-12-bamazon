# Inventory App

This is a terminal app that tracks inventory using a MySQL database. The customer version displays all items available and asks the customer what item they would like order and the quantity. If there is a sufficient quantity of the desired item, the app updates the database and gives the customer their total cost. If the inventory is insufficient, the customer is notified and the database invdntory is not changed.

The manager version of the app can show all products available for sale or show only the items with low inventory. The user can then add to the inventory of an existing item or add an entirely new item to the database.

Technologies used:
